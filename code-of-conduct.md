Nova Code and Coffee is an inclusive informal co-working session. People of all skill levels bring their personal projects--building an app, writing a blog, going through programming exercises. Feel free to come and work, help, socialize or just have a chat!

We hope to create an environment in which all individuals can participate in a positive and affirming way. Behavior that contributes to this sort of environment includes using welcoming and inclusive language, being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences, gracefully accepting constructive criticism, focusing on what is best for the community at large, and showing empathy towards other community members.

Nova Code & Coffee is committed to providing an experience that is safe and free from harassment or offense for everyone, regardless of personal attributes such as gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, place of work, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. We expect members to act in good faith to avoid intentionally offending others.

Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the admins.

If you are being harassed or offended by a member of the community, notice that someone else is being harassed or offended, or have any other concerns, please contact Kalimar Maia [kalimar.maia at gmail dot com]. I will respond as promptly as I can.
