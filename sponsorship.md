# Nova Code & Coffee Meetup Sponsorship Opportunities


Nova Code & Coffee is an inclusive, informal, co-working session that includes more than 2,000 local technologists and meets every two weeks. Our meetings typically draw 45-70 people who are interested in working on their various technology projects in a social environment. People of all skill levels bring their personal projects--building an app, writing a blog, going through programming exercises, etc. Some of the technologies you will see: Javascript, Ruby, C++, Go, Rust, Python, Java, Android, Swift.

Sponsoring our meetings is a great way to get involved with the local technology community.

Which of these sponsorship options best suits your needs? Please let us know so that we can make arrangements for you to sponsor some of our upcoming events!

## Bi-Weekly Sponsors:

We need venue, food and beverages. In return, each sponsor will:

  * be thanked by the MC
  * have an opportunity to introduce themselves during our opening <a href="#standup">stand-up</a>
  * be thanked on the MeetUp event page and twitter.
  * On-going sponsors will be listed on the [Meetup Sponsors](https://www.meetup.com/NoVA-Code-Coffee/sponsors/) page.

### Food Sponsor

Sponsor food for our bi-weekly meetup!  Food sponsorship is roughly *$200 for each event*. We ask that the food sponsor provide breakfast pastries (donuts, croissants, etc) and paper goods sufficient to feed the meeting attendees.  

## Beverage Sponsor

Sponsor beverages for our bi-weekly meetup!  Beverage sponsorship is roughly *$100 for each event*.  We ask the beverage sponsor to provide coffee in sufficient quantities for the meeting attendees.  As a general rule, one commercial carafe serves 25 people. The group generally prefers coffee from smaller vendors such as [Northside Social](http://northsidesocialarlington.com/).  
  
## Venue Sponsor

Provide us a space for up to 100 participants, and be OK with food and drinks. If you need an attendee list for security, we'll send the RSVP the afternoon of the MeetUp

## Logistics

We can help coordinate ordering, pick up and delivery of food and beverages.

Nova Code & Coffee does not share contact information of our attendees with our sponsors.  However, sponsors are more than welcome to ask meeting attendees to share their information.

Please contact Kalimar Maia [kalimar.maia at gmail dot com] to arrange your sponsorship of Nova Code & Coffee.

<a name="standup"/>**Stand-up** is the only formality of the event. Everyone stands in a large circle and introduces
themselves: name, project they are working on, if they are hiring, any upcoming events they want to share, etc.
